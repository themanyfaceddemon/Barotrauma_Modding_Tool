# Mod Loader
![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/themanyfaceddemon/Mod_Loader?label=release)

### Overview
`Mod Loader` - This tool is designed to ease the headache of managing modifications. It currently supports the following features:

- **Mod Conflict Detection**: Scans and identifies overwrites between mods to streamline conflict management.
- **Dependency-Aware Sorting**: Automatically sorts mods based on registered dependencies, ensuring they load in the correct order.
- **Easy Integration for Modders**: Simple setup that doesnâ€™t require interaction with the main repository. Examples can be found [here](./metadata_example.xml) and in the [InternalLibrary directory](./Data/InternalLibrary) (except for `auto_pars` - there is no god there).
